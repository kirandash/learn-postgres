# Mastering PostgreSQL: Build Lightning-Fast, optimized, Scalable Databases

## 1. Introduction to PostgreSQL

### 1.1 Introduction

### 1.2 Setup

- Install postgres
  - https://www.postgresql.org/download/
  - https://postgresapp.com/ (Recommended)
- PostgreSQL GUIs
  - https://tableplus.com/download
- psql cli: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html#:~:text=psql%20is%20a%20terminal%2Dbased,or%20from%20command%20line%20arguments.
  - terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL

### 1.3 Postgres and Other Databases out there

- Other DBs
  - MySQL, SQLite
- Benefits of using Postgres
  - Extensibility
  - Performance
  - Powerful and feature rich
  - Community support
  - It is right tool for a lot of scenarios but not all
- We wil focus on Postgres ex: full text search
  - but in other scenarios such as real-time data, we might use other databases or elastic search etc.
- We will cover in depth some use cases where Postgres shines but also where it doesn't

### 1.4 psql cli

- we are going to use tableplus mainly but feel free to use psql cli
- make sure you have psql installed
  - `psql --version`
- connect to a database
  - `psql -d master_postgres_demo`
  - `psql -U kirandash -d master_postgres_demo`
- list databases
  - `\l`: this is the meta command
  - alternatively, you can run SQL command: `SELECT datname FROM pg_database;`
- create a database (not psql command, but SQL)
  - `CREATE DATABASE master_postgres_demo;`
- list tables
  - `\dt`
- help
  - `\?`
- quit
  - `\q`
- list users
  - `\du`
- describe ðŸ”¥
  - \d
  - describe table
    - `\d kirantest_example1`
- Expanded display ðŸ”¥
  - `\x auto`
  - to turn off: `\x`
- Note: psqlrc file
  - `~/.psqlrc`
  - `psqlrc` is a configuration file that allows you to set defaults for your psql session
  - https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Psqlrc

### 1.5 What is a PostgreSQL schema?

- In other databases ex: MySQL or SQLite you have a database and tables

  - In Postgres, you have a database and schemas
  - A schema is a namespace that contains named database objects such as tables, views, indexes, data types, functions, and operators
  - Each database contains a `public` schema by default and can contain multiple schemas
  - each schema can contain multiple tables

- Comparison with SQLite:
  - You have a file and database
    - and each database has multiple tables
- Comparison with MySQL:
  - You have a MySQL server
    - and each server can have multiple databases
      - and each database can have multiple tables
- Postgres is a bit different
  - You have a Postgres server or Postgres cluster or Postgres process
    - and each server can have multiple databases
      - and each database can have multiple schemas
        - and each schema can have multiple tables

### 1.6 What is a Table Schema and Guidelines on defining it?

- Note that the PostgreSQL schema is different from the table schema
  - Table schema is the structure of the table
  - Schema in Postgres is a namespace that contains named database objects. So please understand the difference based on the context
- Table Schema Guidelines ðŸ”¥:
  - Make sure the schema is SMALL and not too big
  - Make sure the schema is SIMPLE
  - Make sure the schema is REPRESNTATIVE OF THE DATA to be stored ðŸ”¥ (Very Important)
    - Postgres has a wide range of data types. As a developer you need to choose the right data type for the right data
    - Why it is important?
      - this is not just to save the data space because space is cheap
      - but it is Mainly to make sure the bounds and indexes etc are correctly applied and postgres has a lot of utilities that might be helpful based on the data type
        - ex: postgres has uuid data type, jsonb data type, etc. so use them rather than using text or varchar
      - it will help with DX and also with indexing and performance etc.

### 1.8 TablePlus

- TablePlus is a modern, native tool with an elegant UI that allows you to simultaneously manage multiple databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Redis, and more.
- I am going to use TablePlus in this course
- I will be using the free version of TablePlus

## 2. Understanding Data Types:

### 2.1 Integer Data Types

- Smallint or Int2

  - Storage: It uses 2 bytes of storage.
  - Range: -32768 to +32767 (-2^15 to 2^15 - 1)
  - Use case: It is used when you need to store small integers. Ex: Age does not need INTEGER OR BIGINT
  - In MySQL there is a concept of `UNSIGNED` or `SIGNED`. In Postgres, there is no such concept. So, you can store both positive and negative numbers or you can add a **check constraint** to make sure it is positive
  - It sets the COMPACT data type for the data but it does not set the bounds. So, you can store any number in it. If you want to set the bounds, you can use `CHECK` constraint

- Integer or Int4

  - Storage: It uses 4 bytes of storage.
  - Range: -2147483648 to +2147483647 (-2^31 to 2^31 - 1)
  - Use case: It is used when you need to store integers. Ex: zipCode

- Bigint or Int8

  - Storage: It uses 8 bytes of storage.
  - Range: -9223372036854775808 to +9223372036854775807 (-2^63 to 2^63 - 1)
  - Use case: It is used when you need to store large integers. Ex: phone number
