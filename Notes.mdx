# Mastering PostgreSQL: Build Lightning-Fast, optimized, Scalable Databases

-- DAY 1 --

## 1. Introduction to PostgreSQL

### 1.1 Introduction

### 1.2 Setup

- Install postgres - we are using v17
  - https://www.postgresql.org/download/
    - Homebrew: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/postgresql@17 or
    - postgress.app: https://postgresapp.com/
- PostgreSQL GUIs
  - https://tableplus.com/download
- psql cli: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html#:~:text=psql%20is%20a%20terminal%2Dbased,or%20from%20command%20line%20arguments.
  - terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL
- DB version Management Tool
  - https://dbngin.com/

### 1.3 Postgres and Other Databases out there

- Other DBs
  - MySQL, SQLite
- Benefits of using Postgres
  - Extensibility
  - Performance
  - Powerful and feature rich
  - Community support
  - It is right tool for a lot of scenarios but not all
- We wil focus on Postgres ex: full text search
  - but in other scenarios such as real-time data, we might use other databases or elastic search etc.
- We will cover in depth some use cases where Postgres shines but also where it doesn't

### 1.4 psql cli

- we are going to use tableplus mainly but feel free to use psql cli
- make sure you have psql installed
  - `psql --version`
- connect to a database
  - `psql -d master_postgres_demo`
  - `psql -U kirandash -d master_postgres_demo`
- list databases
  - `\l`: this is the meta command
  - alternatively, you can run SQL command: `SELECT datname FROM pg_database;`
- create a database (not psql command, but SQL)
  - `CREATE DATABASE master_postgres_demo;`
- list tables
  - `\dt`
- help
  - `\?`
- quit
  - `\q`
- list users
  - `\du`
- describe ðŸ”¥
  - \d
  - describe table
    - `\d kirantest_example1`
- Expanded display ðŸ”¥
  - `\x auto`
  - to turn off: `\x`
- Note: psqlrc file
  - `~/.psqlrc`
  - `psqlrc` is a configuration file that allows you to set defaults for your psql session
  - https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Psqlrc

### 1.5 What is a PostgreSQL schema?

- In other databases ex: MySQL or SQLite you have a database and tables

  - In Postgres, you have a database and schemas
  - A schema is a namespace that contains named database objects such as tables, views, indexes, data types, functions, and operators
  - Each database contains a `public` schema by default and can contain multiple schemas
  - each schema can contain multiple tables

    <img src="./schema.png" alt="Schema Illustration" height="300" />

- Comparison with SQLite:
  - You have a file and database
    - and each database has multiple tables
- Comparison with MySQL:
  - You have a MySQL server
    - and each server can have multiple databases
      - and each database can have multiple tables
- Postgres is a bit different
  - You have a Postgres server or Postgres cluster or Postgres process
    - and each server can have multiple databases
      - and each database can have multiple schemas
        - and each schema can have multiple tables

### 1.6 What is a Table Schema and Guidelines on defining it?

- Note that the PostgreSQL schema is different from the table schema
  - Table schema is the structure of the table
  - Schema in Postgres is a namespace that contains named database objects. So please understand the difference based on the context
- Table Schema Guidelines ðŸ”¥:
  - Make sure the schema is SMALL and not too big
  - Make sure the schema is SIMPLE
  - Make sure the schema is REPRESNTATIVE OF THE DATA to be stored ðŸ”¥ (Very Important)
    - Postgres has a wide range of data types. As a developer you need to choose the right data type for the right data
    - Why it is important?
      - this is not just to save the data space because space is cheap
      - but it is Mainly to make sure the bounds and indexes etc are correctly applied and postgres has a lot of utilities that might be helpful based on the data type
        - ex: postgres has uuid data type, jsonb data type, etc. so use them rather than using text or varchar
      - it will help with DX and also with indexing and performance etc.

### 1.8 TablePlus

- TablePlus is a modern, native tool with an elegant UI that allows you to simultaneously manage multiple databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Redis, and more.
- I am going to use TablePlus in this course
- I will be using the free version of TablePlus

## 2. Understanding Data Types:

### 2.1 Integer Data Types

- Smallint or Int2

  - Storage: It uses 2 bytes of storage.
  - Range: -32768 to +32767 (-2^15 to 2^15 - 1)
  - Use case: It is used when you need to store small integers. Ex: Age does not need INTEGER OR BIGINT
  - In MySQL there is a concept of `UNSIGNED` or `SIGNED`. In Postgres, there is no such concept. So, you can store both positive and negative numbers or you can add a **check constraint** to make sure it is positive
  - It sets the COMPACT data type for the data but it does not set the bounds. So, you can store any number in it. If you want to set the bounds, you can use `CHECK` constraint

- Integer or Int4

  - Storage: It uses 4 bytes of storage.
  - Range: -2147483648 to +2147483647 (-2^31 to 2^31 - 1)
  - Use case: It is used when you need to store integers. Ex: zipCode

- Bigint or Int8

  - Storage: It uses 8 bytes of storage.
  - Range: -9223372036854775808 to +9223372036854775807 (-2^63 to 2^63 - 1)
  - Use case: It is used when you need to store large integers. Ex: phone number

### 2.2 Fractional Data Types - Numeric

- Integers are fast and efficient, but they are not suitable for storing fractional numbers because they are not precise
  - ex: weather temperature today is 25.5 but we don't want to store the decimal then we can use integer
- Floating point numbers are approximate and not precise
  - Floating points are faster than numeric but they are not precise
  - ex: currency prices, we need to be close but not exact
- Numeric data types:

  - used to store numbers with a fractional component
  - Numeric data types are precise and accurate but they are slower and use more storage than the integer data types and floating point data types
  - ex: research data, scientific data, financial data, etc.

- Numeric
  - https://neon.tech/postgresql/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-numeric
  - The NUMERIC (or DECIMAL) data type in PostgreSQL is highly flexible and can represent a virtually unlimited range of values, constrained only by the maximum precision and scale allowed by PostgreSQL.
  - Range: -10^131072 to 10^131072
  - Storage: variable
  - argument: precision and scale
    - precision: total number of digits
    - scale: number of digits to the right of the decimal point
    - ex: `NUMERIC(5, 2)` means 5 digits in total and 2 digits to the right of the decimal point
      - ex: 123.45 or 12.34 will work but 1234.56 will not work because the total number of digits is 6 which is more than 5. another ex: 123.456 will not work because the number of digits to the right of the decimal point is 3 which is more than 2
    - scale is optional
      - ex: `NUMERIC(5)` means 5 digits in total and 0 digits to the right of the decimal point
    - scale can be negative
      - ex: `NUMERIC(5, -2)` means 5 digits in total and 2 digits to the left of the decimal point

### 2.3 Fractional Data Types - Floating Point (real, double precision)

- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-numeric.html
- supports fraction, not precise (approx) but fast
- use case:
  - weather, temperature, etc.
- Real:
  - Storage: 4 bytes (32 bits)
  - Precision: 6 decimal digits precision
  - ex: 123.456
  - alias: float4
  - Note: `FLOAT(p) Syntax` where if p is 1-24, then it is internally mapped to real i.e. 6 decimal digits precision
- double precision:
  - Storage: 8 bytes (64 bits)
  - Precision: 15 decimal digits precision
  - ex: 123.456789012345
  - alias: float8
  - Note: `FLOAT(p) Syntax` where if p is 25-53, then it is internally mapped to double precision i.e.e 15 decimal digits precision

### 2.4 Compare speed of different data types

### 2.5 Monetary Data Type - Money ðŸ¤‘ (Not recommended)

- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-money.html
- DO NOT USE MONEY DATA TYPE ðŸš¨
  - It is not precise as it is only precise to 2 decimal places
  - It is not recommended to use the money data type as it defaults to USD
- lc_monetary
  - The lc_monetary configuration parameter determines the currency symbol to be used by the to_char function when converting a money value to a string.
  - ex: `SET lc_monetary TO 'en_US';`
  - This only sets the currency symbol but does not automatically convert the number to the currency

### 2.6 Solutions to store money? (Recommended)

- store as integer (used by stripe and other similar companies)

  - fastest and most efficient but slightly less accurate
  - store as cents
  - ex: 100 cents = 1 dollar
  - ex: 10000 cents = 100 dollars

- store as numeric

  - precise and accurate
  - store as dollars
  - ex: 100.00 dollars

- store currency identifier in a new column along with the amount
  - ex: currency: USD, amount: 100.00
